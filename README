####################################### MesRonSH v(1.0) #############################################################3

How to start:
a)Download MesRonSH .
b)copy shellrc file to HOME DIRECTORY and rename to .shellrc
c)create .shellconf file in home directory and keep all user define environment variables
d)compile shell.cpp using g++ compiler
e)Run executable file created.

Functionalities :

1)INternal commands
	command                   options                  arguments            Description
a)	cd			  nil                      nil                  go to home directory
        cd                        -                        nil                  go to previous directory
        cd                        ~                        nil                  go to home director
	cd                        nil                      directory(PATH)      go to that directory
	cd                        $                        environment variable cd directory if environment variable is valid path
b)      pwd                       nil                      nil                  prints current directory
c)      export                    nil                      argumets(a=b)        sets environment variable a to b
d)      history                                                                 displays history
e)      flush                                                                   flushes history
f)      !                                                  pattern              search for pattern in history and execute latest command matches
g)      &                                                  command              execute command(process) in background and prints its ID
h)      fg                                                 ID                   bring process with ID to foreground
i)      exit                                                                    exit MesRonSH
j)      $                                                  ENV Variable         USE env variable eith any external internal commands including echo
k)      echo                      $                        ENV variable         to print value of ENV variable


2)EXTERNAL commands:
Supports all EXTERNAL commands like (ls,vim,g++) stored in bin or path. with all possible arguments
all commands support ~(HOME DIRECTORY) and $(ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE)

3) PIPES 
supports multiple PIPES(|).

4) REDIRECTION
*NOTE REDIRECTION only works with space seperation(" ")
a) <  for input redirection 
b)<<  for input on fly(i.e) heredoc..... 
c) >  for output redirection(CREATE FILE if not exist)
d)>>  for output redirection in append mode(CREATE FILE if not exist)

5)Constraints:
a)**Provide Space with REDIRECTIONS
b)after using fg and bringing process to foreground prompt is lost and there is no way to send process back to backgrouns.You have to wait for process to over.
c) works on linux environment only

6)Submission contains
a)shell.cpp (source code) to compile
b)shellrc(SHELL ENVIRONMENT)
	note: rename to .shellrc and copy to your home directory
c)shellconf(ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES)
for user defined environment variables
only an example to how to use it.
change DOWNLOADS and DESKTOP variables to your system path and try cd $DOWNLOADS or ls $DESKTOP .
	note : change accordingly and rename to .shellconf and copy to your home directory
d) README

7)other details
a) history command create .shellhistory file in home directory do not delete it
b) heredoc create .shell_heredoc temporarily

8) Sorry for warnings while compiling and lengthy and not well modularized course :)


PLEASE REPORT BUF IF ANY
